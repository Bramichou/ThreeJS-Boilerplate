# A boilerplate that start a Three.JS project

## Start a project
This project use yarn instead of npm, why ? Because it is more FAAAAASSTTTT :) So let's install yarn  [click here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

Then you have to install dependencies with

```
yarn
```

Which is like npm install.


### Build the project

To build the project, run

```
yarn start
```

### If you have a white screen after that, just reload the page, the browsersync will not be broken

#### Minify and uglify

To minify and uglify the project, run

```
yarn minify
```

Then let's get creative ! :)


Boilerplate for Three.JS that create a very basic scene.

This boilerplate use Gulp with Babel for ES6, Browerify & BrowserSync
